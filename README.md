- [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

Make sure you follow them.

## Project Specific

**Note: Never run yarn clean command, otherwise it will crash our app.**

1 - Try to use some good editor/IDE.

2 - Make sure your editor/IDE have support for the following:

- ES6/React/JSX/Babel
- .gitigonore
- .editorconfig

3 - Use single 'QUOTES' only.
